        <p>Event management involves overseeing, managing and

             an event. This can be any type of organized gathering: conference, wedding, charity gala, etc.

        that the event takes place under the best possible conditions. They make sure to follow an event planning which includes the progress of the stages and the role of each actor. They therefore manage personnel, finances, as well as relations with the various suppliers.</p>
