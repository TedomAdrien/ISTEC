        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>NGOs are very popular in Africa and Cameroon in particular. In this part of the world 
            service delivery to the public is not the exclusive privilege of the state because of its limited resources. Groups not aligned to the state but with official authorization from the state to operate have become involved in this act of reaching out to the public. Most of them started as simple associations regrouping few persons but with time transformed into professional organisations employing many persons who carry out their activities.
             This has necessitated the training of skilled personnel for this arm of public service.</p>
